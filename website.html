<h1 style="text-align:center; font-size:30px;">Digital Culture</h1>
<p>Digital culture refers to culture shaped by the emergence and use of digital technologies. Digitalisation has become a particularly pervasive influence on culture due to the emergence of the internet as a mass form of communication, and the widespread use of personal computers and other devices such as smartphones. Digital technologies are so omnipresent around the world that the study of digital culture potentially encompasses all aspects of everyday life, and is not limited to the internet or modern communication technologies.

<h2>Cultural forms</h2>
Given that digital material is easily copied, spread and modified, digital cultural products are potentially in a constant state of ‘becoming’, in some respects more adequately described as processes rather than finished products. This is why for instance the established cultural form ‘narrative’, along with authorship, has been problematised in networked, hyperlinked digital environments: products are never complete, reading paths are hyperlinked and networked, and relationships between creators and audiences often anti-hierarchical and products collaborative constructions. (Miller 2011, 21-30) Collaborative digital art, online fan fiction and internet memes are just some examples of such present-day cultural production.
